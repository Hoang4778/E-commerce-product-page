# E-Commerce Product Page

## Description

This project is a good practice of manipulating the DOM, handling **click** events and dealing with responsive design.

## How to run it on local machine

In this project, I simply used vanilla JavaScript so you can open the page in the `dist` folder in VS Code with Live Server or directly in your OS directory

## What this page is here for

It seems to be the easy stuff to work out, but with this design, it gives me ideas about structuring the product page, picking the right color for the design.

## Live version
